## Getting Started

Time to start! Follow us step by step and you'll be just fine, we recommend using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), it's free and easy to set up Jekyll sites on.

### Installation

First, put this `<script>` tag at the end of your `<body` in HTML.

```
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1D10T1C-STUD10S/frontsearchjs/main/src/script.js"></script>
```

This script will be the main script component but you will still need to define variables, but that's for later.
